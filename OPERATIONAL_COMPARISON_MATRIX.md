## Presentation Talking Points

### Opening Context
*"Beyond the numbers, operational flexibility and functionality can be just as important as fuel costs or emissions. These three systems represent fundamentally different approaches to ship propulsion—each with distinct operational characteristics that extend far beyond pure cost comparison."*

### Point-by-Point Walkthrough

**[On Fuel Flexibility]**
> "The dual-fuel system has a significant advantage here. It can burn heavy fuel oil, low-sulfur fuel oil, **or LNG**. This is insurance—if LNG isn't available at a port, you switch to diesel. If you're outside emission control areas where heavy fuel oil is allowed, you can use the cheapest option. The other two systems are locked into a single fuel pathway."

**[On ECA Compliance]**
> "All three can operate in emission control areas, but here's the critical difference: dual-fuel and hybrid do so *natively* without fuel switching penalties. The diesel-mechanical system must use expensive low-sulfur fuel in these zones. This is a 20-30% fuel cost premium just for regulatory compliance—that compounds over a 20-year vessel life."

**[On Zero-Emission Port Operations]**
> "This is where hybrid truly shines. It delivers zero-emission port operations for up to 3 hours. The others must run engines even when the ship isn't moving. As port emission regulations tighten—which they are in every major city worldwide—this becomes increasingly valuable. We're not talking about future regulations; we're talking about regulations *being implemented right now* in EU ports."

**[On Fuel Availability]**
> "LNG's weakness is clear: bunkering infrastructure. While marine diesel is available at nearly every port globally, LNG infrastructure is concentrated in Northern Europe and growing in Asia. This isn't a permanent limitation—the infrastructure is expanding—but it *is* a current operational constraint. The dual-fuel system mitigates this with its diesel backup."

**[On Redundancy]**
> "The hybrid system has superior redundancy because with four gensets, you have N+1 coverage at all operational modes. If one genset fails, you still have full power. The diesel-mechanical and dual-fuel systems each have a single main engine—that's a critical single point of failure. If it fails, you're calling for a tow."

**[On Operational Complexity]**
> "The diesel-mechanical system is the simplest to operate—it's exactly what crews have been doing for decades. Dual-fuel adds real complexity with gas handling, tank management, and dual-mode operations. It requires specialized training and certification. Hybrid requires sophisticated power management systems, but—and this is important—the electric propulsion itself is actually quite simple, and the automation handles most of the complexity."

**[On Future-Proofing]**
> "Looking ahead: the dual-fuel system is the most future-proof because it can adapt to whatever fuel the industry moves toward. We're seeing serious interest in bio-LNG, synthetic LNG, and potentially hydrogen blends. The hybrid has excellent expansion potential too—you could add more battery capacity as technology improves and costs drop. The diesel-mechanical system? It's increasingly constrained by whatever fuel technologies exist in 2040."

**[Conclusion]**
> "The key insight is that there's no universally 'best' configuration. It depends entirely on the customer's specific routes, port calls, regulatory environment, and risk tolerance. But *this* matrix gives you the framework to make that decision systematically."
